# Japanese Kuzushiji Character Classification


## Getting Started
### Contents of Repository

* **data_manipulation_and_visualization.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook containing all my analysis and visualizations for the project.
* **presentation.pdf** contains my powerpoint presentation for a non-technical audience.
* **Data** is a directory containing:
  * **flatiron_data** contains all data provided by Flatiron School as CSV files. Data comes from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TMDB.
  * **kaggle_the_movies_dataset** contains all data from Kaggle's [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) as CSV files.
  * **tmdb_keyword_data.csv** is a backup file of data I got from TMDB on keyword data, originally produced in my Jupyter Notebook.
* **Images** is a directory containing images used in this README.

### Prerequisites

The standard packages for data analysis are required–NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib––as well as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html#) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) for classification models. Below are examples of their installations using Anaconda.

```
$ conda install -c anaconda numpy
$ conda install pandas
$ conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
$ conda install scikit-learn
$ conda install -c conda-forge keras
```

## Built With

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) - Documents containing live code and visualizations.
